# Pitch Prep Section
(This is Mark’s 10 minute pitch prep info dump, based on a format developed by Monica Lunin, friend of our company)

## Who is talking to who?

### Who we are:

Denis, Lana and Mark - enthusiasts about AI, LLMs, tech writing, tech docs, getting stuff done

### Who’s the audience:

All of Shippit - including execs, technical staff, non technical staff, external partners who may be interested in what we are doing next with AI

## Context:

It’s ShipFest, our annual hackathon, where the goal is to develop a winning 5-minute pitch about a new endeavour, process or idea to champion for the wider company to commit to

## Culture:

Shippit team culture


## I. Purpose

Receive recognition that this problem (dev and API docs) is important and should be solved, and also that this problem can be solved effectively with new tools (LLM techniques)

Spread some buzz inside the company about new frontiers of LLM technologies and demonstrate how we can imagine specific uses to suit our team goals - in ways which supplement and boost the capabilities of our team members

## II. Info

### Problems

### Background info:

* The existing API can be slow and inflexible, lacks certain self service features… this must be addressed with future development

Existing users of the API find that:

* Errors are inconsistent or not well described

* Field names are inconsistent from endpoint to endpoint

* Content in the documentation may not be relevant

* APIs are not versioned between updates

There is a project to modernise the API and as this happens, new documentation and guides will need to be written

Development to change and upgrade the API is a work in progress and should be always on - it’s not a momentary one and done - work must be invested and docs must be kept current.

Deals can be lost due to limits with the API, or customers may delay engaging with the system due to lack of understanding of how to integrate or if integration is needed.

Partners need more out of the API and they need less friction - they would benefit from closer and more relevant guides, examples, SDKs, datasets, etc

Premonition also has a related problem. We have a lot of content in the API with a lot of endpoints and usages, but without any description about how to use it. More writing must be done

Enterprise users use a high volume of API requests - we expect new enterprise users to require good API experiences.

A larger problem is that although we have recognition of the seriousness of issues with API, we do not necessarily have resources to revamp and rework all APIs as they are now. We need a solution which starts from where we are now and is able to work backwards and repair what we have, and also be ready for future changes that are coming in the future.

## Solutions

### Reality/Background facts:

These problems are serious, and a serious attempt must be made at designing and implementing an API that is fit for Shippit’s current and future uses, and strategically commits to maintaining that API.

What we’re looking at here with LLM’s is a way to:

* Produce better development guides for the here and now for Shippit’s existing API

* Including helpful guides to work around existing gotchas or common mistakes

* Design a sustainable way forward to keep these guides up-to-date for future versions of the API and have ways to create new docs on-demand when needed

* Makes a start on exposing aspects of the new V5 API where appropriate

The LLM angle:

* New developments in LLM technology allow loading extra RAG / facts / context of up to 1 million or so tokens (Gemini 1.5)

* This increasingly allows business specific information to be uploaded to LLM platforms and to be used as a knowledge-base assistant.

Using this assistant, we found it easy to develop large chunks of text for example:
* Document overview and table of contents
* Identify common problems and gotchas
* Enumerate possible errors
* …and more?

Once the context is loaded, more questions can be asked. Although it can’t fully replace the work of human experts, it’s helpful for reading in lots of information and drafting and comparing.

## III. Structure

This is a pitch, so the best way to go about this is:

60 pc of time describing the scope of the problem and how serious it is

20 pc of time describing what our solution is and how it solves the problem

20 pc of time describing how it works and what more that we need

## IV. The pitch deck

Gemini - go have a crack?

(Will return and draft some slides)
